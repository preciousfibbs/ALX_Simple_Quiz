## 📘 Project 1: Simple Interactive Quiz

### 📄 Description

A basic quiz web app that presents a multiple-choice question and checks the user’s answer. The app provides immediate feedback based on the selected response.

### 🎯 Features

- Interactive radio-button-based quiz
- Answer validation using JavaScript
- Real-time feedback displayed to the user

### 💡 Learning Objectives

- Selecting and retrieving user input
- Comparing values using conditionals
- Updating the DOM dynamically
- Handling click events

### 🧱 Files

- `index.html` – Structure of the quiz
- `styles.css` – Styles for the quiz
- `quiz.js` – JavaScript logic for answer validation

### 📌 How It Works

When the user selects an answer and clicks the "Submit Answer" button, the script checks if the selected value matches the correct answer (`4`) and updates the page with either:
- ✅ `Correct! Well done.` or
- ❌ `That's incorrect. Try again!`

## 🧮 Project 2: Simple Calculator

### 📄 Description

An interactive calculator for performing basic arithmetic operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — on two user-provided numbers.

### 🎯 Features

- Input validation using `parseFloat`
- Clickable buttons for each arithmetic operation
- Result displayed dynamically

### 💡 Learning Objectives

- Working with numeric inputs and default values
- Writing and using functions for each arithmetic operation
- Attaching multiple event listeners to buttons
- DOM manipulation for real-time updates

### 🧱 Files

- `calculator.html` – Structure of the calculator
- `calculator.css` – Styling for the calculator interface
- `calculator.js` – Logic for performing arithmetic operations

### 📌 How It Works

Users enter two numbers and click on one of the four operation buttons. The appropriate function is executed, and the result is displayed immediately on the page.
